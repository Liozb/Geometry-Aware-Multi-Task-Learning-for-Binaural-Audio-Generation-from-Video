## Overview

This repository is based on the paper **["Geometry-Aware Multi-Task Learning for Binaural Audio Generation from Video"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10882)**.  
The original work presents a novel framework for generating spatial (binaural) audio from video input by leveraging geometry-aware multi-task learning.

I have adapted and extended the official implementation provided by the authors, introducing several modifications and improvements tailored to my specific use case and experiments.
